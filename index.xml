      <description>Food Printing is set to revolutionize how we think about food. Rather than using metals and plastics to lay down layers, 3D Food Printing uses edible food-based pastes that can be layed down in infinite numbers of patterns, textures, and flavors. The implication of this goes well beyond just simple snacks. It allows chefs to create delicacies that are impossible to do by hand, but also has the potential to reach consumer homes.</description>

      <description>280,000 Americans have spinal cord injuries, 58% of which are categorized as quadrepeglic and have lost function in all four of their limbs. These individuals have singnificantly reduced mobility and often have to live in dedicated homes or have full-time caretakers that they rely on in order to complete daily tasks. The reliance on a caretaker greatly restricts the freedom of the quadrepelic to the working hours of the caretaker, and can have serious consequences if something were to go wrong.</description>

      <description>Humans are social creatures. Robots could be too. Robotics are often conceptualized to fulfill a specific purpose. They are programmed to assemble a car, traverse rough terrain, or suture a wound. These specialized robots are useful, of course, but each requires significant resources to build, design, and develop and often have a physical shape that would prevent it from specializing in other tasks. Swarm robotics are the exact opposite. A swarm is made out of relatively simple objects that can communicate in order to accomplish larger tasks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing since I was a kid. Here&amp;rsquo;s a abbreviated portfolio of some of my recent work.
 A cute sticker and patch set kickstarter that was successfully 200% funded from it&amp;rsquo;s initial goal. Also kicked off having a etsy store for my artwork

      <title>My Other Computer Flies on A Balloon</title>

      <description>45% of the world does not have access to the internet. Loon aims to change that. We provide internet via huge high-altitude balloons that transmit wifi signals from serviced regions, between balloons, and back to users on the ground. They have no motors onboard the balloons, instead using the stratification of winds in the eponymous stratosphere to navgiate the world.
I am currently working as a Flight Engineer. My role is half mission control and half software programming.</description>

      <description>Connie Mabel Zhang has a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and flies balloons that provide internet for a living. She is interested in connected devices and the potential of distributed networks, and hopes to one day apply those concepts to robots.</description>
