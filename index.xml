      <description>https://loon.co/ We provide internet via huge high-altitude balloons that use winds to navigate and transmit wifi signals between them and back to the ground.

I am currently working as a Flight Engineer at Project Loon. My role is half mission control and half software programming, which pushed me to go back to software.</description>
